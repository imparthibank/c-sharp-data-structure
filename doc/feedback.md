# Performance Review Update

I wanted to share an update regarding my ACR and performance review.

## Ratings
- **Job Requirements and Operational Objectives:** "Being Developed"
- **Behavioral Aspects:** "In Line with Expectations"

## Reflections and Feedback
I acknowledge the feedback and ratings, though I was surprised to be rated as "Being Developed," especially given my consistent efforts over the past three years. These efforts included taking on critical tasks outside my team’s scope to ensure their successful delivery.

During the mid-year review:
- I mentioned that I delivered everything assigned to me in the best way possible and am proud of my accomplishments.
- I highlighted that the tasks I had been working on over the past six months were repetitive and did not offer significant learning opportunities.
- I expressed my interest in taking on more functional or impactful work. However, due to our Kanban model of work, I couldn't foresee upcoming tasks with clear directions.

To address this, I proactively picked up and delivered key initiatives beyond my team’s responsibilities.

## Career Growth and Future Steps
Additionally, I heard from my manager about potential budget cuts and headcount reductions. After receiving my ratings:
- I had a conversation with Sudhakar to better understand the situation.
- I conveyed my gratitude for everything I’ve learned from this team and expressed my interest in exploring internal opportunities for career growth.

Initially, Sudhakar seemed surprised by my decision but ultimately supported my intention to explore roles through internal mobility.

I look forward to contributing meaningfully in my next steps and continuing to grow in my career.
